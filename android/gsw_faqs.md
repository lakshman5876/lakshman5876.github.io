#### Why does it take so long for getting GPS satellites ?
* For fast GPS updates you need to have open sky above. A minimum of 3 to 4 satellites is required for getting GPS fixes. Also the satellite data is cached in the device and if the GPS has not been used recently then this may be stale and will take some time to refresh

#### What is almanac and ephemeris?
* Almanac is longterm and imprecise satellite data which is typically invalidated every few months.

* Ephemeris is shortterm and precise satellite data which is typically invalidated by the GPS engine in a couple of hours. The GPS engine requires at least 4 satellites to get a fix. With precise ephemeris data the accuracy and time to fix improves.

* More satellites with valid ephemeris the better the accuracy
