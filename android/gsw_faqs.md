#### Tech Notes:-

#### What is almanac and ephemeris?
* Almanac is longterm and imprecise satellite data which is typically invalidated every few months.

* Ephemeris is shortterm and precise satellite data which is typically invalidated by the GPS engine in a couple of hours. The GPS engine requires at least 4 satellites to get a fix. With precise ephemeris data the accuracy and time to fix improves.

* More satellites with valid ephemeris the better the accuracy
