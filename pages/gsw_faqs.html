        <h3>Purchase Issues</h3>
        <p>
            The most common issue few users face is when purchase is charged/completed but premium features are not unlocked.
            This is mainly because app depends upon play store app to refresh purchases which sometimes gets delayed.</p>
            <b>Try these steps</b>
        <ul>
            <li>If you can try and wait 24 to 48 hours for play store purchases refresh</li>
            <li>Click recents button and close all apps. Then open play store app once.</li>
            <li>Force stop play store app. Then open play store app once.</li>
            <li>Force refresh play store app. From Android Settings -> Apps -> Play store -> Clear cache. Then open play store app once.</li>
            <li>Use the same google account from which purchases have been made.</li>
            <li>Try reinstalling app. Then open play store app once.</li>
            <li>Try restarting device. Then open play store app once.</li>
            <li>Check network connection is available.</li>
            <li>Try on another device</li>
            <li>Have you got the purchase confirmation email from google? This is the important step to confirm the purchase has been actually charged.</li>
            <li>If the above steps are not giving result send me an email. I will check purchase status using your email id.</li>

        <h3>Tech Notes:-</h3>
        <h4>What is almanac and ephemeris?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Almanac is longterm and imprecise satellite data which is typically invalidated every few months.</li>
            <li>Ephemeris is shortterm and precise satellite data which is typically invalidated by the GPS engine in a couple of hours. The GPS engine requires at least 4 satellites to get a fix. With precise ephemeris data the accuracy and time to fix improves.</li>
            <li>More satellites with valid ephemeris the better the accuracy</li>

        </ul>
