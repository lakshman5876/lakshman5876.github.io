    <h3>What does this App do exactly?</h3>
    <p>This App helps you to find and delete unecessary files and apps which are taking up space.
        It attempts to put control in the hands of the user by helping to identify apps and files taking up space.
        It does not automatically delete apps or files</p>

    <h3>Some Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>File analyzer</b> - quickly locate that big video file or zip file</li>
        <li><b>File manager + treesize</b> - quickly check which folder has become very big</li>
        <li><b>App analyzer</b> - Visualize how much space an app is actually occupying.
            Then you can decide if you want to clear its storage or totally uninstall it.
            System apps can not be uninstalled.
            But many of them can be disabled which prevents them from taking user space
        </li>
        <li><b>Junk files</b> - Generally look for unnecessary files to delete in Download, DCIM, Movies, Music or Pictures folders.
            Avoid deleting files from Android folder.
            It contains app related files which are automatically removed if app is uninstalled
        </li>
        <li><b>Cache</b> - A quick way to clear some space is by clearing app cache using the Clean cache option.
            But this is a temporary fix since the cache is restored quickly.
            A more lasting way is to uninstall apps or delete some files
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Purchase Issues</h3>
    <p>The most common issue few users face is when purchase is charged/completed but premium features are not unlocked.
        This is mainly because app depends upon play store app to refresh purchases which sometimes
        gets delayed.</p>
    <p><b>Try these steps</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you can try and wait 24 to 48 hours for play store purchases refresh</li>
        <li>Click recents button and close all apps. Then open play store app once.</li>
        <li>Force stop play store app. Then open play store app once.</li>
        <li>Force refresh play store app. From Android Settings -> Apps -> Play store -> Clear cache. Then open play store app once.</li>
        <li>Use the same google account from which purchases have been made.</li>
        <li>Try reinstalling app. Then open play store app once.</li>
        <li>Try restarting device. Then open play store app once.</li>
        <li>Check network connection is available.</li>
        <li>Try on another device</li>
        <li>Have you got the purchase confirmation email from google? This is the important step to confirm the purchase has been actually charged.</li>
        <li>If the above steps are not giving result send me an email. I will check purchase status using your email id.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>General Widget issues</h3>

        <li>Widgets freezing - Start and exit app</li>
        <li>Widgets freezing - Try restarting device</li>
        <li>Widget update notifications - Disable by double clicking widget or long pressing App icon -> Notifications -> Disable</li>
        <li>If app has been moved to sdcard please move it back to internal storage. Widgets will not work when app is installed in sdcard.</li>
        <li>Try reinstalling app</li>
        <li>There may be some utilities like battery savers, memory optimizers, task killers etc which may be interfering with the app.
